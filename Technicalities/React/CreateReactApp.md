# 🚀 How to Create a React Application (Beginner to Pro)

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- [**Visual Studio Code** (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [**Node.js** (includes npm)](https://nodejs.org/) – install the LTS version

---

## ⚙️ Steps to Initialize Your React App

### 1. Open the Desired Folder

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app:

- **Linux/macOS**: Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  cd ~/your/desired/path
  code .
  ```
- **Windows**: Right-click on the folder and select **“Open with VS Code”**

> 💡 **Tip**: If `code .` doesn't work, install the VS Code CLI from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`)

---

### 2. Create the React Application

Run the following command inside the VS Code terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app your-project-name
```

Replace `your-project-name` with your preferred app name (no spaces).

---

### 3. Wait for Setup to Complete

The CLI will:
- Install React
- Set up Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and more
- Create the full file structure under your new project folder

> ⏱️ This may take a few minutes depending on your system.

---

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, navigate into your project folder:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm start
```

This will launch your app in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
